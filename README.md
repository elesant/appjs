TO DO: [![Live Demo](https://usekite.com/live-demo-button.png)](undefined/deploy) [![Live Demo](https://usekite.com/live-demo-button.png)](http://localhost:3000/deploy) [![Live Demo](https://usekite.com/live-demo-button.png)](https://localhost/deploy)
- Add bottom nav bar with paging buttons, kik and open in web
- Add photo viewer when you click on an image

BUGS:
-- BUG - YouTube videos appear in Chrome when running localhost - but don't show on the device (how come?)
-- BUG - Add thumbnailer to send via kik - when gifs are shown can fail to attach if they are very large
-- BUG - Slide Viewere bug - every 3rd page/final page, unable to click on the page/eating the touch events
-- BUG - When default images are added to an article they are not attached when you send via Kik (inconsistent UI, should add default image)
-- BUG - When you quickly scroll and switch views there is a flash of the image as you scrol (video from Adam)
